## what is php?

 PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. `Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting,but you can do much more with it`

Nice, but what does that mean by it can be embedded into HTML? An example:

```php
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <?php
            echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
        ?>

    </body>
</html>

```

# What can PHP do?

Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.

## There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.

- Server-side scripting.
- Command line scripting.

`bcoz we dont have any root(index.php) file to open!`

`now you have to create some folder and file In WWW (M IAWD 2401/class-1/variable.php) dir then if you see on the browser its showing like this`


![folder-create?](./ss-images/newFolderCreateinwww.png)

`in M IAWD 2401 Folder`

![folder-create?](./ss-images/inmiawdfolder.png)

```you can notice that there have `Parent Directory` thats mean **M IAWD 2401** is the parent of this folder.now you can create a file and run this and show the output in the browser using the localhost:folderNameOrFilename also you can navigate```
