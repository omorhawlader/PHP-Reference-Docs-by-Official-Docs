> now all we need to do! just go to your installing dir like me `C:\laragon\www`. how you can create folder or file to play the php code or do some project! previous screen-short we can see a page this is coming form the `C:\laragon\www\index.php` as a root. if you delete this file then its show blank white screen with `Index of` text!

`bcoz we dont have any root(index.php) file to open!`

`now you have to create some folder and file In WWW (M IAWD 2401/class-1/variable.php) dir then if you see on the browser its showing like this`


![folder-create?](./ss-images/newFolderCreateinwww.png)

`in M IAWD 2401 Folder`

```you can notice that there have `Parent Directory` thats mean **M IAWD 2401** is the parent of this folder.now you can create a file and run this and show the output in the browser using the localhost:folderNameOrFilename also you can navigate```
